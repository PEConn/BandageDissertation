{\Huge \bf Abstract}
\vspace{24pt} 

This dissertation implememts systems for providing spatial pointer safety in C.
Both a fat pointer approach, where the additional information is stored with the pointers and a meta-data approach where the information is stored seperately and associated with the pointers are implemented and compared.
Finally the performance benefit gained by using a CCured-like analysis to detect and remove needless bounds checks is investigated.

\cite{jones1997backwards}.
This is the introduction where you should introduce your work.  In
general the thing to aim for here is to describe a little bit of the
context for your work --- why did you do it (motivation), what was the
hoped-for outcome (aims) --- as well as trying to give a brief
overview of what you actually did.

It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into 
this chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or 
a particularly interesting finding). 

It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the
document, although without care this can appear formulaic 
and tedious. Your call.
