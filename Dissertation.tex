\textbf{Abstract}

This dissertation implememts systems for providing spatial pointer safety in C.
Both a fat pointer approach, where the additional information is stored with the pointers and a meta-data approach where the information is stored seperately and associated with the pointers are implemented and compared.
Finally the performance benefit gained by using a CCured-like analysis to detect and remove needless bounds checks is investigated.
