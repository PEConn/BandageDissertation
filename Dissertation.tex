\vspace{24pt} 

This dissertation implememts systems for providing spatial pointer safety in C.
Both a fat pointer approach, where the additional information is stored with the pointers and a meta-data approach where the information is stored seperately and associated with the pointers are implemented and compared.
Finally the performance benefit gained by using a CCured-like analysis to detect and remove needless bounds checks is investigated.

\cite{jones1997backwards}.
This is the introduction where you should introduce your work.  In
general the thing to aim for here is to describe a little bit of the
context for your work --- why did you do it (motivation), what was the
hoped-for outcome (aims) --- as well as trying to give a brief
overview of what you actually did.

It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into 
this chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or 
a particularly interesting finding). 

It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the
document, although without care this can appear formulaic 
and tedious. Your call.

\section{Software Engineering Practices}

The use of a strong test suite was invaluable during the implementation, and the only thing I would change if I did this again would be making it even stronger.

In terms of implementation costs, implementing Bandage took considerably more effort and was far more bug prone than implementing SoftBound.
This is in large part due to Bandage changing the representation of pointers - making the change from raw pointers to fat pointers required a considerable amount of code to be written in one piece - if the entire change did not work, the source programs would break.
In the SoftBound implementation however, the implementation could be broken down into small pieces (eg providing bounds for local variables, then passing them through functions), and at each stage the source programs would compile, though the checking may not be complete.

Although this does provide a nice guarantee with Bandage that if the program compiles, bounds checking is more likely to be thorough, it creates an all-or-nothing situation in the presence of cases that haven't been implemented where Bandage either breaks the code or performs well, while Softbound can provide bounds checking for that that has been implemented.

Initially, only the Bandage system was to be implemented.
Therefore keeping the Bandage transformation pass separate from the CCured-like analysis pass proved beneficial as it could be easily reused to provide the same information to the SoftBound transformation.

Unexpected setbacks were discovered in trying to run the Softbound transformation on the Raspberry Pi, as both uthash and memtables required modification to run on 32-bit systems.
